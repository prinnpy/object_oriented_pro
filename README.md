> A program that allows input of the ship length, grid location, and orientation. 
Assume the grid where the submarine is to be placed is a 10 by 10 grid and is 
indexed as described in Assignment 1. Randomly generate 15 torpedo shots in 
the main of the program, output the shot grid locations to the screen, and then 
output whether the torpedo hit any ship and if it did, whether that ship was sunk.
