# Homework 02
> Build two grids which are each X wide and Y long where X and Y are user inputs to determine
the size of the grids. Fill each cell of both grids with a ‘0’. Randomly fill 1/3 of the grid’s cells
with a ‘1’. You must randomly fill each of the two grids separately so they do not have the all of
the same squared filled with a ‘1’. Compare the two grids (square by square comparison) to
find squares which have a ‘1’ in both grids. Create a third grid which contains a ‘1’ in squares
where both of the compared grids contain a ‘1’ and has a ‘0’ in any other square.
